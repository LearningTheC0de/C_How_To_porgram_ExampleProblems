# C_How_To_porgram_ExampleProblems
 This is the Example problems completed from the book "C How To Program (Seventh Edition) by Paul Deitel & Harvey Deitel. This is my attempt at the problems and not all of them are completed. Please be aware that this is not the only way way to go about these and they are not optimized. I hope this helps, happy coding :)
